- **`/pages`**: This folder contains all the page components of your application. Each page component corresponds to a route.

- **`/components/ui`**: This sub-folder inside the `components` directory houses reusable UI components like buttons, text inputs, and other UI elements.

- **`/hooks`**: Custom React hooks used throughout the application are placed in this folder. This helps in reusing logic and maintaining clean code.

- **`/services`**: Contains all services that the application consumes, such as API calls, context providers, and state management setups.

- **`/utils`**: This folder includes utility functions and helpers that do not fall into the other categories but are still essential for the operation of the application.
